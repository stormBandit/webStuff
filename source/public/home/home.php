                    <p>
                        I am a fourth year coop student at the University of Guelph, pursuing a Major in Computer Science
                        and a minor in Business. I have experience designing, implementing and testing various systems across
                        web and mobile platforms. I have spent four years developing my skill as a software engineer and
                        becoming familiar with a variety of tools and languages popular in the industry. I have had experience
                        working with both frontend and backend services and frameworks. I am well versed in using Amazon
                        Web Services for building out backend services in the cloud. I have a keen interest in the cyber
                        security industry and may pursue a masters degree in cyber security after my undergrad.

                            Tulip Retail has an innovative product, a powerful cloud-based, mobile platform built to

                            The iOS app used by store associates is an extremely powerful tool to connect associates
                            with customers in a brand new way. The idea of introducing omnichannel avenues into a
                            brick-and-mortar store has been revolutionary thus far and continues to pick up momentum.

                            Through this process Tulip has become an industry leader in the market space, with nobody
                            else doing what Tulip is doing.

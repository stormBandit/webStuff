                    <p>
                        I am a fourth year coop student at the he University of Guelph, pursuing a Major in Computer Science
                        and a minor in Business. I have experience designing, implementing and testing various systems across
                        web and mobile platforms. I have spent four years developing my skill as a software engineer and
                        becoming familiar with a variety of tools and languages popular in the industry. I have had experience
                        working with both frontend and backend services and frameworks. I am well versed in using Amazon
                        Web Services for building out backend services in the cloud. I have a keen interest in the cyber
                        security industry and may pursue a masters degree in cyber security after my undergrad.

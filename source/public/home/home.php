                    <p>
                        I am a fourth year coop student at the University of Guelph, pursuing a Major in Computer Science
                        and a minor in Business. I have experience designing, implementing and testing various systems across
                        web and mobile platforms. I have spent four years developing my skill as a software engineer and
                        becoming familiar with a variety of tools and languages popular in the industry. I have had experience
                        working with both frontend and backend services and frameworks. I am well versed in using Amazon
                        Web Services for building out backend services in the cloud. I have a keen interest in the cyber
                        security industry and may pursue a masters degree in cyber security after my undergrad.

                            Tulip Retail has an innovative product, a powerful cloud-based, mobile platform built to
                            empower store associates. Tulip brings the best of online retail to brick-and-mortar stores
                            by delivering a powerful application that enhances the in-store experience.
                            <br><br>
                            The iOS app used by store associates is an extremely powerful tool to connect associates
                            with customers in a brand new way. The idea of introducing omnichannel avenues into a
                            brick-and-mortar store has been revolutionary thus far and continues to pick up momentum.
                            Tulip has become a leader in arming retailers with important data and tools for success.
                            Through this process Tulip has become an industry leader in the market space, with nobody
                            else doing what Tulip is doing.
                            <br><br>
                            Ali Asaria, CEO of Tulip Retail, first founded the company well.ca before moving on to found
                            Tulip. Well.ca is an online health, beauty and pharmaceutical retailer based entirely in
                            Canada. Ali was also the man behind the BrickBreaker game found on BlackBerry devices from
                            his days working at Research in Motion. Ali started Tulip Retail in Waterloo, ON in 2013 and
                            has quickly grown in size to almost 200 employees across Canada, the U.S. and Europe.

                        <p style="text-align: left">
                            During my 4 month co-op at Tulip I worked on a small team which serviced the client
                            <a href="https://well.ca/" target="_blank">well.ca</a> for updates and bug fixes to their
                            website and online systems. The small team dynamic meant that we all had to be able to work
                            with all components of the very large and intricate website. I learned to use the agile
                            software development process to iterate over tasks and move them through the
                            development cycle efficiently. I spent a lot of time learning to use 3rd party APIs and
                            building RESTful APIs for internal usage. Using
                            <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a> to work locally for development
                            and testing  before pushing our code changes to a staging environment, before pushing to
                            production.
                            <br><br>
                            Tulip Retail was an incredible place to work, I was fortunate to experience the rich culture
                            of a tech startup in the heart of Toronto. The benefits of working in a startup doesn't just
                            end with the culture, there was an immense amount of support and encouragement given by all
                            members of the team. Sometimes my manager would be too busy, managing, but I
                            would still be able to find the assistance I needed to complete a task through other
                            channels in the company. Being my first co-op position this was a huge advantage to me,
                            enabling me to learn a vast amount of skills and expand my knowledge of many different
                            topics.

                        <p style="text-align: left">
                            Brock Solutions was a great place to work and gain experience relevant to my career goals.
                            Being that I had previously worked in a startup company, there was quite a 'cultural shock'
                            when I first started. The dynamics of the two workplaces are much different, and I feel
                            grateful for being able to experience the structured, team based, goal driven environment
                            at Brock Solutions. The incredible team atmosphere was enlightening, there was always a
                            team member available to assist me in even the smallest of tasks. The goal oriented
                            atmosphere was also something I found valuable, having constant updates on timelines,
                            release dates, due dates for proposals etc. As a developer I often worry about the
                            speed at which I get things done, having frequent updates on timeline for project completion
                            takes a lot of that stress away.
                            <br><br>
                            At Brock Solutions all of the developing is done on Windows machines, which was a great
                            learning opportunity for me since I barely use windows at all anymore and have never coded
                            on Windows. I had only ever used Git as a version control system before coming to Brock,
                            where instead of Git's Distributed Version Control style, they use
                            <a href="https://www.perforce.com/" target="_blank">Perforce</a> which is a Centralized
                            Version Control. This was also an excellent chance for me to pick up new skills and become
                            more familiar with different types of software.

                            Revyoome is a startup company developing an iOS and Android application for bringing the
                            online world of reviewing information into the ever booming social media industry. As the
                            company is still early in its stages of growth and much of the content we worked on is
                            private, there is not much that I can disclose about the actual product of the company.
                            However I can speak about my experience during this unique opportunity. As a third year
                            university student I could never have imagined myself being placed in a management position
                            to lead a team of developers to build a mobile application from the ground up.
                            <br><br>
                            My role at Revyoome was to manage a small team of developers and to oversee the development,
                            quality management and testing of the software as well contribute to the design of the
                            application. As a team we built an entire cloud based backend infrastructure to a mobile
                            application using Amazon Web Services (AWS). I built a
                            <a href="https://www.phacility.com/phabricator" target="_blank">Phabricator</a> instance on an
                            <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2" target="_blank">AWS EC2</a> instance to host our project
                            management and code review software. We used phabricator to enforce organization on the
                            project, help with task workflow and have a well established form of communication
                            throughout the project.
                            <br><br>
                            I was directly involved in designing, implementing and continuously improving a data model
                            and mysql database schema for the project. The data model continually got more complex,
                            adding new functionality to the app meant adding new components to the backend database.
                            I was also responsible for performing code reviews on a regular basis while managing a
                            development and beta environment. Both environments consisted of their own set of databases,
                            cloud based serverless functions
                            (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" target="_blank">AWS Lambda</a>)
                            as well as their own set of users
                            (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/" target="_blank" >Amazon Cognito</a>).
                            I created a local working environment for the developers on the project to allow local
                            machine development without causing disprutions to other developers. I set up a Docker
                            container for a local database and used
                            <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/serverless_app.html" target="_blank">
                                AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model)</a> to build and test their backend functions locally.

                            It was an incredible journey and has been a priceless learning experience for me.I was faced with many
                            challenges during this project and feel that I learned far more than I have during any of
                            my past experiences. I also feel that I developed my skill as a leader and grew as a person, bringing me closer to
                            my preofessional goals.

                        <h4 style="color: #B200FF">My Time At Revyoome</h4>
                        <p style="text-align: left">
                            Few people can say that they were the first employee hired for any company, I was hired as
                            the senior technical lead and the product manager. Although these were my official titles,
                            often times in a startup environment the roles we take on tend to blend together into many
                            other roles.
                            <br><br>
                            Some days I acted entirely as a the companies database administrator, spending my time
                            researching better ways to design our quickly growing data model, and how to increase
                            efficient of our MySQL queries. I spent an entire day with an outside consultant
                            planning and designing the use cases of our data model before ever beginning to build up
                            our database. I learned that it is a huge advantage to plan out as many possible use cases
                            before ever starting to development a database schema and to try and anticipate various
                            modifications that may come down the line. The time it takes to plan this out is minimal
                            compared to the time it takes to rework your entire database design because of a new feature
                            the client asks for. There were a few times throughout the term where I had to rework the
                            schema in order to accompany a new feature, and many of these cases could have been avoided
                            if I had done more searching for best practices in the first stages of design. One of the
                            most valuable lessons I learned while working with the database for Revyoome was that no
                            matter what I was trying to accomplish, my first solution to the problem was almost always
                            less efficient than some other solution. Five minutes on
                            <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a> was often all it
                            took to find a better solution or to learn a new tool that is built into the MySQL engine.
                            We decided to use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds" target="_blank">Amazon RDS</a> to
                            host our database because of its flexible, scalable and overall ease of use. No set up of
                            servers or maintenance on our end meant more time for developing!
                            <br><br>
                            Many of my days were spent as the project manager, performing code reviews, testing completed user stories and merging tasks into the development environment.
                            I constructed a <a href="https://www.phacility.com/phabricator" target="_blank">Phabricator</a> project, running on an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2" target="_blank">Amazon EC2</a> instance, for
                            project management purposes. Phabricator is a great tool for managing task creation and tracking, and has
                            built in Git support, which is crucial to be able to perform code reviews without compromising the main development branch. A major
                            lesson I learned during the course of my work term is the importance of using version control software properly. It is importance to always having a branch dedicated
                            to working code, for the purpose of always having a place to branch off from to start a new task and more importantly to have a demonstrable product at all times. Nothing
                            is more frustrating then trying to demo to the client (or in this case the CEO) and have a bug on the current branch.
                            <br><br>
                            I was given the unique opportunity to manage the entire project of Revyoome, which meant that I was in charge of the user story creation and assignment
                            for both the Android and iOS side of the development team. I also did my fair share of development for both sides of the mobile application, which was very rewarding
                            in that I now have experience in both Swift and Java for mobile development. A major piece of the application that I contributed to both the Android and iOS side was the
                            sign-up, sign-in and sign-out process. I used <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/" target="_blank">Amazon Cognito</a> to authenticate users to be given access to our serverless backend.
                            <br><br>
                            Speaking of the backend, one of my largest responsibilities was the design and development of our entire backend, including our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/apigateway/" target="_blank">Amazon API Gateway</a>
                            which featured all of the endpoints to our backend serverless <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" target="_blank">Amazon Lambda</a> functions. We used NodeJS to write our
                            backend code because of its asynchronous abilities and because I really wanted to get to know this language due to its growing popularity. At first there were
                            a lot of issues with how the code ran asynchronously, but once I got the hang of using Promises, it became a very powerful and efficient tool.
